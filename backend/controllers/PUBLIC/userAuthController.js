// A Mongoose schema defines the structure of the document, default values,
// validators, etc., whereas a Mongoose model provides an interface to the
// database for creating, querying, updating, deleting records

// REMINDER ALL METHODS HERE FOR QUERYING ARE MONGOOSE METHODS
// lean() mongoose method:
// still executes the query but:
// Docs returned from queries with the lean option enabled are plain javascript
// objects, not Mongoose Documents. They have no save method, getters/setters, virtuals,
// or other Mongoose features. lean is great for high-perf, read-only cases
// exec() mongoose method:
// executes the query that is built
// EXEC VS NO EXEC:
// use of exec() method depends on the type of query you are executing
// if the query returns a cursor to a set of documents, you can use await
// directly on the Query object returned by Mongoose. But if you are
// executing a query that returns a single document, you need to call the
// exec() method to execute the query and return the document.
// in 'general' if passing something in to query, use .exec
